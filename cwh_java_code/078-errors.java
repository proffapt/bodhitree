// Three types of errors:
// 1. Syntax Errors
/*
	Linguistic errors.. sometimes you might not understand why that particular thing is syntaxual not logical..
	Whatever error your compiler throws regarding the syntax of the language.
	A very precise trick to debunk it is..

	This won't let you compile the code!
	Example:
	int a=5;
	System.out.println(a+b);
	b doesn't exist.. this is not logical error.. it is syntaxual.

	PROGRAMMER FACES THESE
*/
// 2. Logical Errors
/*
	Program will get compiled + will be running smoothly
	but it will start doing something else.. from what it was supposed to do..

	like you coded to get sum.. and instead of that you got product.. that's a logical error.

	PROGRAMMER FACES THESE
*/
// 3. Runtime Errors aka EXCEPTIONS!
/*
	Program will get compiled and will run too..

	Things like.. user gave unhandelable data and your program crashed..
	things which are not in your control.. wanted to allocate mem for pointer.. but your heap is full
	wanted to fetch something from server.. but the server is down.

	USER FACES THESE
