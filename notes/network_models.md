# TCP/IP - the one used

> ATNP

### Application Layer

- Application + Presentation + Session Layer of OSI model.
- Still called the 7th layer.

### Transport Layer

- Stinkin' same.

### Network Layer

- Stinkin' same.

### Physical Layer

- Physical + Data-Link layer of OSI model

# OSI - the ideal one

> APSTNDP

### Application Layer

- Protocols: HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, SMTP, FTP, SFTP etc.
- Portal / Interface for the Application to communicate with the network ahead.
- Directs data to correct program
- Managing communication between Application
- Determines whether adequate resources exist for communication.

### Presentation Layer

- Converts the data to correct data format - HTML, JPG, XML - stuff which browser can understand.
- Gets the data computer ready.
- Encryption stuff as well - SSL.

### Session Layer

- Startup a communication channel from the web-browser(the Application basically) to the server.
- Protocols - L2TP (a lot with VPN connections), RTCP(phone calles), H.245 (videos), SOCKS (proxies).

### Transport Layer

- TCP, UDP and Ports.
- Ensures error-free data delivery between devices.
- Last layer on our device, final packaging, after this layer the data leaves our device.

### Network Layer

- IP addresses.
- How hosts on different networks can communicate.
- Routers.

### Data-Link Layer

- Mac-addresses.
- How hosts on same network can communicate.
- Switches, WAPs.
- Has a Header as well as a trailer to enclose message into a frame.

### Physical Layer

- Ethernet cables, network cards, electricity.
