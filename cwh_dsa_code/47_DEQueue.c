/*
- Insertion and Deletion can be done from both ends..
- Two types of DEQueue:
        * Restricted input DEQueue: Insertion from front is not allowed, rest combinations are allowed.
        * Restricted output DEQueue: Deletion from rear is not allowed, rest combination are allowed.

- Just have to implement these two extra functions
        * enqueuef() and dequeueR()
- Already implemented:
        * enqueueR() and dequeueF()
