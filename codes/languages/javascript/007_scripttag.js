// Integrating JS into your project
/*
	You have to add a <script> tag in your html file, in two ways:
		1. Referencing an external file via the `src` attribute
		2. Writing the JS code right there within the tag.
	
	First method is the preferred method for following reasons:
		- Separation of concerns
		- Caching; our js file is cached when using this method
