/*
    BFS has same concept as that of Level Order Traversal in Binary Tree.
    It focuses on discovering the breadth of the graph first.
    What's breadt? 
      - All the vertices just after the current vertex are 1 Level
      - Then after them lies the 2nd Level

      According to it, we move onto the next level only after completely discovering the current level.
