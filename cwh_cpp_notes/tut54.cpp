#include<iostream>
// Polymorphism //
/*
1) Compile Time Polymorphism: / Early Binding / Static Binding 
Compiler is clear what to call even before running the code.
    ---> Function Overloading
            sum(a, b, c); sum(a, b)
    ---> Operator Overloading
            "+" operator has diff roles.. concatinates.. adds.
2) Runt Time Polymorphism: / Late Binding / Dynamic Binding
Compiler is clear only when the code is run.. to detrmine what to call.
    ---> Function Overriding
            Base class's function is over-written when a child class has a function member of same name.
    ---> Virtual Functions
